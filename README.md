# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This is an application designed to allow a user to type in a city name and then return that city's weather data for a 5 day forcast along with the current day. This is made possible by implementing an API. 

## Usage

To begin, type the name of the city you wish to view the weather of and watch the magic happen! 
This will populate the bottom portion of the screen with today's date and weather conditions as well as the next 5 days. 
Also, the user should be able to see previously searched cities that they have searched. 

Please refer to the following screenshots for an example of the functionality.
